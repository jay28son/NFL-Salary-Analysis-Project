# NFL-Salary-Analysis-Project (IN PROGRESS)

## Overview
Gathered data of top 1000 paid players each year over the past 10 years via web scraping with python. Organized, formatted, and cleaned data using Microsoft Excel. Analyzed data using Mysql and used pandas on python to document sql queries with Jupyter Notebook.

## Softwares Used
1.Python (pandas, web scraping) \
2.MySQL \
3.Excel \
4.Tableau \
5.Jupyter Notebook

## Objectives
1.What position has been paid the most and least over the 10 year span? \
2.How much has the total player market increased or decreased? \
3.What year had the highest increase/decrease in total salary? \
4.Are there any correlations between positions being paid more and individual teams? What about by division?
